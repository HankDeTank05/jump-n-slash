# Codename: Jump 'n' Slash

An action/platforming game we're developing for fun in our free time!

We began prototyping in PICO-8, and had moved over to Love2D after our prototype exceeded the file size limit in PICO-8.
We have since moved to C++ to continue prototyping. We are using a custom-made engine, built using SFML.

After prototyping is finished, we plan to develop in Unreal Engine.
