controls = {
    walk_left = 0,

}

jump_vel = -4 -- the jump velocity
-- this must always be a negative number (does not need to be an integer)
-- this velocity is applied as long as the player is holding the jump button

gravity = 0.2 -- vertical acceleration per frame
-- this must always be a positive number (does not need to be an integer)
-- gravity is only applied after the player releases the jump button or after they've held the jump button for the max amount of time

max_jump_frames = 15 -- the max number of frames a player can hold jump for
-- this must always be a positive integer
-- assume 60fps (30 = half second, 15 = quarter second, etc.)

walk_speed = 1 -- horizontal movement speed
-- this must always be a positive integer
-- pixels per frame
-- screen res is 128x128

p1_attack_frames = 10 -- number of frames that attack hitbox is active for
-- this must always be a positive integer
-- assume 60fps
