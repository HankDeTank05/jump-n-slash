\section overview_scene Overview
A scene is an environment which contains all the objects relevant to a certain situation.
A scene could be any of the following:
- a level in a game
- a hub world or world map
- a title screen or game over screen
- a shop
- something else?

A game cannot exist in this engine without at least one scene, so a starting scene needs to be specified before the game can be run.
