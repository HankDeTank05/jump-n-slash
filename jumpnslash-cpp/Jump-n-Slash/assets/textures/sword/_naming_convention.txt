- Spritesheets will be created by the automator. You do not need to create your own.
- Everything between angle brackets <shouldBeCamelCase>. Do not use underscores in names unless it's part of the naming convention.
- Files you would like to store in this folder but you don't want to be processed by asset automation should begin with a leading underscore.
